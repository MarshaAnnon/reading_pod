<!-- This page should also display an image of the book cover, the books attributes - title, author, author_bio, book_summary
<%#= @pod.book_pods.title %>??
STRETCH GOALS - links to purchase the book (physical & audio). Weekly prods. I think I need to assign an overall admin who can edit and update the pods

< button_to "Join Reading Pod", ??? would this update action, method: "patch" %>

- Join this pod should add this pod to the users pod listing
- It should indicate that status has changed and the user is now a member of this pod
- It should display a message welcoming the user to the pod
- It should start a countdown to the book read finishing time.
